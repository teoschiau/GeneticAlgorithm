SIMPLE GENETIC ALGORITHM 

In the beginning a set of individuals (population) is randomly initialized. 
Afterwards, the algorithm runs iteratively (iterations are called generations). 
In each iteration, the quality (fitness) of each individual is evaluated and mating selection is performed. 
The mating selection creates a set of pairs of individuals that will create new offspring. 
Then, genetic operators (crossover and mutation) are applied to the individuals in the mating pool in order to create a set of offspring. 
Finally, the population is replaced by the new population of offspring.
